      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>I a simple girl with a heart full of dreams. I strive to keep growing no matter what challenges come my way. One of the biggest struggles I’ve faced is dealing with self-doubt and anxiety, especially when it comes to public speaking. Because of my shyness, expressing myself in front of others has always been hard. But I’m not someone who gives up easily—I’m working hard to improve and gain confidence little by little. I believe that someday, I’ll be able to speak with courage and pride</p>

      <h2>MY GOALS</h2>
      <p>Looking ahead, I see myself in five years as a stable and passionate professional, working in a company where I can continue to grow both personally and professionally. I know life won’t always be easy, and success doesn’t come without struggles. But I’ve learned that recognizing your weaknesses and being open to help from others is a true strength. That’s what keeps me moving forward—to live with magis, to practice cura personalis, and to be a woman for others. This is not just a dream for me—it’s a promise.</p>
